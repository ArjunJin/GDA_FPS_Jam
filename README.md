# GDA_FPS_Jam

What is this project?
During the FPS Jam, participants will be given access to a Unity project that contains a pre-built framework for the creation of FPS weapons. Participants will create their own folder for their work and submit their folders as Unity package files, not altering the pre-existing framework of the project.

Whether you’ve used Unity before or not, we’ve designed the project to be as accessible as possible, so feel free to make some crazy weapons!

The end result after the jam will be a compiled training range with all weapon jam submissions in one range, letting everyone who wants to see and test out the weapons experiment with them in the training range!
